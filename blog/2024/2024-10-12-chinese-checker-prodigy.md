title: The Chinese Checkers Prodigy
---

When I was young, I used to hang out in my dads office. They had a recreation room with indoor games, news papers and magazines. One fine day, my dad taught me chinese checkers. He won the first game and I won the second game. Thats how I spent years thinking I was a prodigy at chinese checkers. Thanks Dad.
