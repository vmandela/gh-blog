title: About Me
---

I am an engineer currently working in Texas Instruments, Bangalore, India. I
currently lead the Boot ROM development team that caters to TI's Jacinto, Sitara
MPU and Sitara MCU product lines. Prior to this role, I designed and implemented
firmware for the secure enclave on TI's current generation of automotive chips.
I have also worked on Display drivers/applications and boot time optimizations on the
previous generation devices. I have designed and implemented the software radio
framework in use across multiple generations of TI's automotive processors.

At my previous employer, Sarnoff India, I worked on porting computer vision
algorithms to DSP. My alma-mater is [Indian Institute of Technology,
Madras](http://www.iitm.ac.in/).
