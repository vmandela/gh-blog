Prior to this role, I designed and implemented firmware for the secure enclave on TI's current generation of automotive chips.
I have also worked on Display drivers/applications and boot time optimizations on the previous generation devices. 
I have designed and implemented the software radio framework in use across multiple generations of TI's automotive processors.
